# Agro SOS: Revolutionizing Agriculture with Satellite Monitoring and Direct Sales

## Project description

Agro SOS is an innovative application prototype developed during the ActinSpace Hackathon. The app leverages data from Galileo and Copernicus satellites to monitor and display essential information about soil conditions in agricultural areas. It continuously tracks parameters such as pH, temperature, humidity, chlorophyll levels, and nutrients (N, P, Ca, O2, among others), providing farmers with valuable insights to optimize their agricultural practices. Additionally, Agro SOS introduces a unique feature that enables farmers to market their produce directly to consumers through direct sales channels. This novel approach not only improves transparency in food production but also strengthens the connection between producers and consumers. Under my leadership, the Agro SOS team achieved third place in the ActinSpace Hackathon, showcasing the app's potential to transform the agricultural industry.

Agro SOS marks a significant leap forward in agricultural technology, utilizing satellite monitoring and direct sales capabilities to enhance efficiency and transparency in food production. By offering real-time soil data and enabling direct sales channels, the app empowers farmers to make informed decisions and establish direct connections with consumers. The project's success at the ActinSpace Hackathon underscores its innovative nature and the possibility for broad implementation in the agricultural sector.

•  My role was the leader of my team, 'AXIOMA,' and I was the sole developer of this app.

•  My responsibility was to develop a prototype of the app. To achieve this, I utilized tools such as Figma, Flutter, and Postman, as well as data structures like JSON and various libraries, including assets for managing images and icons in Flutter and material resources for accessing widgets.

•  We consulted and filtered information from satellite databases to better understand the available variables and conducted research to determine how to use them scientifically in our project and to comprehend soil behavior and quality.

Additionally, we developed a canvas model to ensure the success of our project.
